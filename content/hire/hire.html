Interested in working with me? Oh good. I was hoping someone reading this might like to pay me for what I can do, rather than just read about it for free.

**Professional**: I work best with the supports that come from a well-run company, so much of the work I do runs through [Quintessential Mischief LLC](http://qmuxs.com). We make systems. Many of them run on computers, but a good portion run on meat-ware too.

**Freelance**: I'm available only under limited circumstances. Generally I determine what these circumstances are on a case-by-case basis, in cooperation with my employer. I don't like my employer to think I'm competing with her. It's not good for our marriage.

[My résumé is available online.][resume] Also, I've scored 'expert' in PHP5,[^php] HTML4.01,[^html] and CSS2.1[^css] at expertrating.com.[^expert] (As my uncle used to say, that and a quarter will get me a cup of coffee. Except I'll need more quarters.)

**Call, write, tweet**: Get in touch. I'd be happy to discuss your project, talk about what if anything we might add to your team, and how we might make that happen for you.

[resume]: http://version2beta.com/hire/resume.html "Résumé of M. Robert Martin, a/k/a version2beta"
[^php]: I scored 9 out of 10 for an 'Expert' performance, but only 85th percentile. My lowest scores were in variables and data types, and advanced concepts, but scored perfect in syntax and PHP5 new concepts. At any rate, I'll be brushing up on variables and data types. You can see the [PDF of my report][php].
[php]: /media/site/expert-rating-php5.pdf "PDF of my test results for PHP5."
[^html]: I scored 9 out of 10 on HTML 4.01 too. That's also 'Expert' performance according to the testing company. I got perfect scores on 4 out of 6 areas (advanced tags, forms and frames, fundamentals, links and images) but scored only 'average' and 'good' on tables and tags, respectively. They show me at the 95th percentile among everyone taking the test. [PDF of my report][html].
[html]: /media/site/expert-rating-html4-01.pdf "PDF of my test results for HTML4.01."
[^css]: Again, 9 out of 10 and 'Expert'. Highest scores in advanced techniques, page media, text and font styles; lower scores in basic styles, fundamentals, and selectors. [PDF report][css].

[^expert]: ExpertRating does testing, especially for prospective employers. Here's their [employment testing][expert] page.
