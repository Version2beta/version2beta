This is part two in a series exploring how Tryton might fair as the heavy-lifting portion of an ecommerce package. This part discusses some of my experiences with members of the Tryton community.

The whole series, at least as planned:

-   [Part 1: About Tryton][]
-   Part 2: Stalking the Tryton community
-   *Coming soon –*Part 3: A general ecommerce specification

## The Tryton community

My first experience with Tryton was two years ago, when we were
evaluating open source ERP packages for a business systems
integration project. I came, I saw, and I moved on to OpenERP,
which offered more features and centralized commercial support. Now
that we have considerably more experience with OpenERP, I’ve come
back for a closer look at Tryton.

I started with the community, and I suspect that is a very valid
approach. I’m looking for a long term relationship. I wanted to
meet the family. So naturally I hid behind some bushes and watched
them for a month or so. Some of the things I noticed:

-   They don’t bicker very much. Like, hardly at all. Most of the
    communication I’ve seen is in non-native English, and they speak
    carefully so as not to be misunderstood.
-   Mostly they are proactive, identifying potential problems and
    solutions before people become invested in various outcomes.
-   They air their laundry (bugs, issues, etc) as well as most open
    source projects. It seems they don’t have as much laundry to air,
    though.

The Tryton family has some key members. I’ve identified some of
them from looking at the services page on the website[^services], some
from the Google groups for Tryton[^groups-general] and Tryton-dev[^groups-dev], and some
on IRC[^irc]. Many of these people I also recognized from the OpenERP
community, as there’s considerable overlap. I’m reluctant to point
names and name fingers (with a nod to Jack Sparrow[^captainjack]) as I’m far
too likely to miss someone’s most excellent contribution, and that
would be an unfortunate oversight.  **Kudos and gratitude to everyone who has worked on Tryton.** Despite my reluctance, I still want to point out a few people.

There is no doubt a reason why the Tryton.org website[^tryton.org] looks so
much like **B2CK Software Development’s website[^b2ck]**. I’ve read
hundreds of emails on the mailing lists from Cédric Krier, Nicolas
Évrard, and others in this company. Clearly these are key people in
Tryton development and I cannot say enough nice things. Cédric is a
programming god: targeted, responsive, attentive, and sharp. I
greatly enjoyed the night Udo Spallek recommended two accessibility
improvements to the Tryton GUI and Cédric replied 52 minutes later
with the one word “Done”.

I already had a healthy respect (perhaps even a geek-crush) on
**Sharoon Thomas**[^sharoon], CEO of **Openlabs in the UK and India**[^openlabs].
Sharoon and Openlabs have written about
using Tryton as a Python module in Django[^django-module],
integrated UPS international shipping with OpenERP[^ups-module], and built
Callisto ecommerce for OpenERP[^callisto] as well as
Nereid for Tryton[^nereid]. Sharoon has clearly already considered the
question of Tryton and ecommerce, as indicated in
his email list discussion on building a Magento Connector for Tryton[^connector]. (My favorite part: “An integration with
Magento does not add 'The best e-commerce possibility for Tryton'
but does make 'A great ERP backend for Magento'.")

Again I want to add, there are others. I can just barely read
French, German, and Spanish, and do not know the developers who
spend most of their time in these channels. Even among the
participants in the English language forums, I’m not representing
everyone here, but I do wish to include them in my appreciation.

### What else is there?

-   [Part 1: About Tryton][]. An overview of Tryton – architecture,
    business model, features, license.
-   Part 2: Stalking the Tryton community. There are some
    impressive people working on this project. I’m pleased to get to
    know them.
-   *Coming soon –*Part 3: A general ecommerce specification. What
    does a Tryton-backed ecommerce system need to do?
-   And more perhaps, as I’m actually doing it.

*If I’ve inspired a response from you (probably the type of response that deserves an apology), mention [@version2beta][] on [Twitter][] and I’ll see it there. Or, if you can’t comment in less than 126 characters (my handle takes 14 characters with a space), blog about it and tweet that.*

  [^connector]: [Sharoon's full quote from the mailing list][connector] is this: "In short I feel that both the connector to magento and integrated e-commerce solution addresses totally different requirements. An integration with magento does not add 'The best e-commerce possibility for Tryton' but does make 'A great ERP backend for magento'. Feel free to ask any of the questions you may have. I am also available on the IRC if you want to talk about this."
