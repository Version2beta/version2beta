Or you can call me version2beta if you like.

## About version2beta ##

My primary job is Chief Superhero at Quintessential Mischief LLC[^qmllc], making systems be more systemic. The rest of the time I get to do all sorts of fun things, like bother famous developers in other countries with odd ideas about how their applications could be more paranoidly secure. Sometimes I work nights building firewalls, servers or workstations, or maybe writing an odd bit of code, or working the obscurity out of uncommon problems. Actualy, I do all of those things during the day quite a bit too.

And once every blue moon, I write something for my blog. That would be this site.

From our clients I’ve learned how valuable a blog can be, provided *someone wants to be a writer*. I am neither a writer nor a blogger, and as such have limited expectations from this blog:

-   A collection of notes about my work. I work with:
    -   Networks (often with OpenBSD[^OpenBSD] and pfSense[^pfSense] in major roles)
    -   Real and virtual servers (both Linode[^Linode] and AWS[^AWS])
    -   Linux (usually Ubuntu[^Ubuntu] and Debian[^Debian])
    -   Databases (usually MySQL[^MySQL] and PostgreSQL[^Postgres] but I’m fascinated by various post-SQL and no-SQL choices).
    -   Programming. I primarily program in languages prefixed by the letter ‘P’: Python, PHP, and Perl, but I sometimes delve deep for my long-lost experiences with C/C++, Forth, .NET, and a dozen other languages.
    -   Platforms. I’m spending most of my time in two platforms: MODX[^MODX] and Tryton[^Tryton], though I strongly suspect I’ll be adding Django[^Django] and Flask[^Flask] to that short list soon.

-   A repository of code and snippets, often just so I can find them later.
-   A place to respond to other peoples’ blogs, because blogging is the new “leave a comment”. (Actually, I think blogging is dead. Or almost. Maybe I’ll blog about that.)
-   I *might possibly* blog nonsense every now and then. You know, only if I’m feeling extremely moved by a subject. You can safely ignore those posts.

Hopefully I’ve set realistic expectations for the reader. Hopefully I will be able to exceed those expectations every now and then.

__Update 5/9/2011:__ See my [Instantiate Blog][] post for more of the whys and wherefores.

  [^qmllc]: [Quintessential Mischief LLC makes systems, especially ERP and ecommerce systems][qm], and we like to customize where appropriate. My real title is Application Architect, but I'm thinking about getting it changed to more accurately reflect what I do.
  [qm]: http://www.qmuxs.com "Quintessential Mischief LLC"
  [^OpenBSD]: [OpenBSD is secure][OpenBSD], and secure is good.
  [OpenBSD]: http://www.openbsd.org "OpenBSD: free, functional, and secure."
  [^pfSense]: [pfSense][] puts OpenBSD's packet filter on a FreeBSD prepackaged system with a front-end management system. Mostly good, and the upgrade to 2.0rc3 was flawless, but I still don't understand why it runs on FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD.
  [pfSense]: http://www.pfsense.org "pfSense project home."
  [^Linode]: Check out [Linode][]. I really like my virtual private servers there.
  [Linode]: http://www.linode.com "Linode stands for Linux Node."
  [^AWS]: I use a number of [Amazon web services][aws]: EC2, S3, CloudFront, etc..
  [aws]: http://aws.amazon.com "From here you can get to all of Amazon's web services."
  [^Ubuntu]: I can install [Ubuntu][] machines all day long. Sometimes, I do install Ubuntu machines all day long.
  [Ubuntu]: http://www.ubuntu.com "Fast, easy, free Linux, with slick packaging."
  [^Debian]: So many of my Linux heroes have worked on the [Debian][] project.
  [Debian]: http://www.debian.org "I like that Debian makes clear it is a Gnu/Linux operating system."
  [^MySQL]: Like many developers I have mixed feelings about [Oracle/MySQL][MySQL].
  [MySQL]: http://www.mysql.com "Oracle has been a bit evil over the last few years, maybe longer."
  [^Postgres]: I was slow to realize how powerful and fast [PostgreSQL][] actually is.
  [PostgreSQL]: http://www.postgresql.org "PostgreSQL is also a fine example of the community open source business model."
  [^MODX]: I used to describe [MODX][] as the best content management system/framework, but I become less comfortable with it as they move toward their commercial open-source business model. I don't begrudge them a profit, of course.
  [MODX]: http://modx.com "MODX content management framework"
  [^Tryton]: [Tryton Enterprise Resource Planning platform][Tryton]. I'm doing a lot of my development in Tryton now, which of course moves us beyond the web and into the warehouse and factory.
  [Tryton]: http://tryton.org "There are some excellent programmers working on this project."
  [^Django]: [Django][] is a legendary Python-based content management framework, created by a major newspaper publisher and used in pretty serious websites all over.
  [Django]: http://www.djangoproject.com "I think I may become a Djangonaut."
  [^Flask]: [Flask][] is a Python microframework, kinda like a smaller version of Django without the ORM and a few other things.
  [Flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask is a Pocoo project, like Pygments and Werkzeug. These people are good."
