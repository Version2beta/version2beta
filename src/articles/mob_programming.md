A friend of mine works in a computer research lab, the lucky bastard, and a year ago he told me how his team of post-docs get together every Friday for about six hours of coding and pizza. They use a big screen TV, one person on the keyboard for the whole session, and as many as ten people contributing to what's getting typed. At first, it was a way for everyone to learn Scala, and also to make sure that the project they were writing wasn't locked up inside one person's head.

A month or so later, I was hanging out with Pat Maddox ([@patmaddox](https://twitter.com/patmaddox)), telling him about my plans for pair programming in the Women's Internship Program I was creating at work. Pat suggested I look at mob programming instead, and I remembered I had looked at mob programming and I loved the idea.
