# version2beta #
Hi, I'm Rob. Or you can call me version2beta if you like.

## About version2beta ##

I'm a coder who's always done his own devops, usually without a net. I focus on functional programming, domain driven design, functional-first programming, functional data stores, and 

I'm a manager who aims to do as little as possible, thereby making time for more. I intend to become VPeng or CTO for a mid-size startup or small-ish, established tech company.

I'm working on projects related to gender diversity on tech teams, building teams of functional programmers, using functional programming in a startup environment, building teams that productively include juniors, and mob programming.

I speak internationally and write here and occasionally on other sites as well.
