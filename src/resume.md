[^coderetreat]: [Code Retreat][coderetreat] is a day-long coding practice event focusing on fundamentals.

[coderetreat]: http://coderetreat.org/ "honing the craft together"

[^pair]: In response to Avdi Grimm's call at Ancient City Ruby for more pair programming experiences, I've put out a remote pair programming welcome mat. For more information, see [my pairing page][pair] and [pairprogramwith.me][ppwm].

[pair]: http://version2beta.com/pair/ "My page on pair programming."

[ppwm]: http://www.pairprogramwith.me/ "Pair widely. Pair often."

[^zibrato]: [Zibrato][zibrato] provides Python decorators and context managers for timing and counting. Metrics are immediately handed over to a

[ZeroMQ][zeromq] queue manager where various backend workers filter data and forward metrics to an appropriate back end such as
[Librato][librato].

[zibrato]: https://github.com/Version2beta/zibrato "Zibrato project on Github"

[zeromq]: http://www.zeromq.org/ "ZeroMQ is a socket library ideal for building queues."

[^pysamlsp]: [Pysamlsp][pysamlsp] is a Python library for SAML2.0 single sign on implementation.

[pysamlsp]: https://github.com/PlaidCloud/pysamlsp "Pysamlsp on Github"

[^modx]: [MODX][] is a PHP-based content management system, originally a fork of Etomite but now a powerful and broadly useful development framework that also provides a user-friendly content manager. MODX was my CMS of choice from 2007 to 2010.

[modx]: http://modx.com "MODX content management framework"

[^drupal]: [Drupal][drupal] is an widely-used open-source PHP framework and content management system.

[drupal]: http://drupal.org/ "Come for the software, stay for the community."

[^django]: [Django][] is an open-source MVC web application framework written in Python with powerful ORM ("object-relational mapper", a way to store programming objects in a database). It's designed for creating complex, database-driven websites efficiently. In fact, their motto is "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines." I think they know something about deadlines, since Django comes from the news industry. The World Company originally developed it, but it's also used by the [New York Times][nyt], [Washington Post][wp], the [Guardian][], and hundreds of other newspapers. It's also used by [Disqus][], which powers the comments on my blog as well as nearly a million other websites and serves nearly a billion visitors a month.

[django]: http://www.djangoproject.com "Django makes it easier to build web applications quickly and with less code."

[nyt]: http://www.nytimes.com/ "The New York Times"

[wp]: http://www.washingtonpost.com/ "The Washington Post"

[guardian]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/ "The Guardian"

[disqus]: http://disqus.com/ "Disqus discussion platform"

[^hyde]: I used to use [Hyde][] to run my site. It's a static site generator &mdash; that means it makes static web pages from templates and content, and Hyde does it using the Django engine and templates. It's not for every site, but when it's right, it's very right.

[hyde]: https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde "Hyde static site generator using Django"

[^flask]: [Flask is a Python-based web application micro-framework][flask], which means it's infrastructure and tools for building small and medium web applications. I use Flask as often as I can, including as the platform that generates this website.

[flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/ "Python microframework based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions"

[^tornado]: [Tornado][tornado] is an asynchronous web server written in Python and designed for high performance applications.

[tornado]: http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ "Scalable, non-blocking web server and web application framework."

[^openbsd]: [OpenBSD][] is considered by many (including me) to be the most secure operating system available to the public. There are stories here. Suffice to say that OpenBSD founder Theo de Raadt is one of my heroes.

[openbsd]: http://www.openbsd.org "OpenBSD operating system"

[^pf]: [pf][] is the nuts and bolts of a secure firewall. Written by Daniel Hartmeier and maintained now by the entire OpenBSD team, it is the most powerful tool I've used for building custom firewalls. Up until I began using pfSense last year, every firewall I built was custom, based on OpenBSD and pf.

[pf]: http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/ "OpenBSD pf FAQ"

[^openvpn]: [OpenVPN][] provides point-to-point and site-to-site virtual private networks, secured and encrypted using strong industry practices, relatively easy and efficient to implement, and open-source.

[openvpn]: http://openvpn.net/ "Open-source virtual private networking software"

[^pfsense]: [pfSense][] is a prepackaged firewall and router than runs on commodity (and specialty) PC hardware. Before I started using pfSense I built very similar systems from scratch using OpenBSD and pf. pfSense, however, makes the interface much more friendly and deployment more efficient. However, it's not based on OpenBSD; it uses OpenBSD's packet filter on a FreeBSD platform.

[pfsense]: http://www.pfsense.org "Free, open-source firewall and router based on Daniel Hartmeier's/OpenBSD's packet filter"

[^drbd]: [DRBD, or "Distributed Replicated Block Device"][drbd] creates a RAID-1 mirrored hard drive across two or more computers on a network. This is incredibly useful for building failover clusters.

[drbd]: http://www.drbd.org "DR:BD network RAID software"

[^linux-ha]: The [Linux High Availability Project][linux-ha] has been writing solid code for running Linux-based clusters since 1999. Their heartbeat program provides the communication infrastructure that allows clustered computers to work together.

[linux-ha]: http://www.linux-ha.org "The Linux High Availability Project."

[^pacemaker]: [Pacemaker][] is a resource management tool for Linux High Availability clusters.

[pacemaker]: http://www.clusterlabs.org/ "Cluster Labs runs the Pacemaker open-source project"

[^iscsi]: iSCSI is "Internet SCSI", or "Internet Small Computer Systems Interface". It's a way to provide SCSI block devices across a network, and powerful tool for creating a cost-effect Storage Area Network. The [Wikipedia article on iSCSI][iscsi] provides a more comprehensive write-up.

[iscsi]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI "Wikipedia article on iSCSI"

[^aws]: [Amazon Web Services][aws] arguably offer the broadest, most scalable virtual hosting product line in the market. I've used more distinct AWS products one one project than most VPS companies offer in total.

[aws]: http://aws.amazon.com "Amazon Web Services"

[^linode]: We have had virtual private servers at [Linode][] since 2008, which is not very long when you consider they started in 2003 &mdash; 3 years before Amazon and others came to the market. I've been uniformly satisfied with the performance of our equipment, and have written several how-to's about hosting at Linode, especially regarding high-availability services. One of the things I particularly enjoy about Linode is that they now have 6 datacenters, 4 in the US, 1 in London, and 1 in Tokyo. Each datacenter also hosts DNS, so when I hosted there, my hosting business was international. Maybe some day I'll have to come up with a reason to get a whole server in the London or Tokyo data center.

[linode]: http://www.linode.com "Linode is Linux Node"

[^rackspace]: I ended up getting a lot of experience with [Rackspace and RackspaceCloud][rackspace], concurrently managing over 70 real and virtual private servers using a platform I wrote using [Fabric][fabric] and [CouchDB][couchdb].

[rackspace]: http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/ "Rackspace Cloud hosting products."

[^storm]: Liquid Web's [Storm on Deman][storm] provides high-performance virtual private servers.

[storm]: https://www.stormondemand.com/ "On-demand hosting infrastructure"

[^ocean]: [Digital Ocean][ocean] offers $5 per month single-CPU virtual private servers with solid state disk drives and a very simple API.

[ocean]: https://www.digitalocean.com/ "Simple Cloud Hosting"

[couchdb]: http://couchdb.apache.org/ "A JSON, Javascript, and HTTP database. Relax."

[^vagrant]: [Vagrant provides virtual machines automatically][vagrant]. These are useful for standing up development and QA environments.

[vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com "Development environments made easy."

[^chef]: [Chef][chef] is Opscode's automated configuration and deployment tool.

[chef]: http://www.opscode.com/chef/ "Configuration management, cloud management, continuous delivery, and more."

[^fabric]: [Fabric][fabric] is a Python library for automating sysadmin tasks on remote systems.

[fabric]: http://fabfile.org/ "Programmatic SSH for application deployment and sysadmin."

[^spork]: [Knife-spork][spork] is a library from Jon Cowie at Etsy for managing cookbook versioning.

[spork]: https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork "A workflow plugin to help many devs work with cookbooks and environments at once."

[^syslog-ng]: [Syslog-ng][syslog-ng] is a powerful system logging utility for Linux and Unix.

[syslog-ng]: http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng "Log management infrastructure."

[^loggly]: [Loggly][loggly] is a cute little log search and management tool that I didn't realize I'd like so much.

[loggly]: http://loggly.com/ "Simplified log management."

[^librato]: [Librato][librato] organizes metrics. I even wrote a [Python library called Zibrato][zibrato] that uses their platform.

[librato]: https://metrics.librato.com/ "Measure everything."

[^newrelic]: [New Relic][newrelic] hooks into your app to show you what's going on.

[newrelic]: http://newrelic.com/ "Application monitoring."

[^openerp]: [OpenERP.com][openerp]. I consult on existing and planned OpenERP deployments.

[openerp]: http://www.openerp.com "OpenERP SA"

[^tryton]: I list Tryton as an ERP package, and believe that it is. However, it's also a business application development platform. See

[Tryton.org][tryton] for more information about this community-driven open-source ERP package. Also, I've written several articles on this site about the software.

[tryton]: http://tryton.org "Tryton is a complete business solution development platform providing modularity, scalability and security."

[^huth]: [Huth Bender's][huth] website is, so far, the most "designed" site I've worked on &mdash; a great example of design within UX.

[huth]: http://www.huthbenders.com "Huth Benders automotive pipe bending equipment"

[^accunet]: It is always a pleasure to work with [Accunet Mortgage][accunet]. The Chief Honesty Officer's title is no gimmick. It's like the olden days, when there was no one more trustworthy than the owner of the local bank.

[accunet]: http://www.accunet.com "Accunet Mortgage offers mortgages in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Florida."

[^fresh]: [Fresh Is Best Inc.][fresh] is a gem of a small business in Milwaukee's Riverwest Business District. They make raw dog food, frozen and freeze dried. Our dogs have been known to balance a piano on their noses for a Fresh is Best [freeze-dried duck heart][fddh].

[fresh]: http://www.freshisbestinc.com "Fresh is Best Inc., raw and freeze-dried dog food and treats"

[fddh]: http://www.freshisbestinc.com/products/pet-treats-chews/freeze-dried-duck-heart-bites "Freeze-dried duck heart bites."

[^topfloor]: This is right from their site, but I like it: "At Top Floor Technologies, companies receive more than just an online marketing program; they receive documented, bottom-line results that executives on the 'top floor' demand." It also explains why I worked in a one-storey building.

[topfloor]: http://www.topfloortech.com/ "Top Floor specializes in web strategy for business."

[^qmuxs]: [Quintessential Mischief LLC][qmuxs] was not originally intended to be the name by which we were generally known. When we first started, we had an idea that I'd do business as Version2beta and she'd do business as Senvara LLC, the company she owned when we married. As it turned out, that lasted only a few weeks. Later, like many couples in business together, we had challenges deciding how we would make decisions related to the business. We ended up compromising: she is now full owner of the company, and I was an employee for a while, and we were happy to work together.

[qmuxs]: http://www.qmuxs.com "Quintessential Mischief LLC builds business systems."

[^keybridge]: Like many real estate developers, KeyBridge fell to the recession in 2008.
