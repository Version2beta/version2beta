# Current status: not in the market

My current position is at [iTV in Provo, UT][itv], where I'm part of a team making platforms that support cultural discourse about broadcast media as it happens. Wild horses couldn't pull me away.

I also support projects and services at [Quintessential Mischief LLC][qmllc], my wife's company. Talk to her about web strategy, search optimization, usability, accessability, and social media. I'm biased, but I can tell you that **she fights for the user**.

I am occasionally available for consultating and small coding or systems administration projects. [My résumé is available online][resume] and you can [email me](mailto:rob@version2beta.com).
