Again.</p>
<h2>Stranger in a strange land.</h2>
<p>This is somewhere around blogging attempt number 12 for me. I feel like
the cheerleader on Heroes<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> announcing yet another failed try at
offing myself. And here I go again.</p>
<p>Actually, I haven’t done horribly. Some of my blogs had a few readers. 2
or 3 a month even. Some high points:</p>
<ul>
<li>grokd.org – an automated blog pulling news clips on autism. Hundreds
of readers a month, probably because I didn’t write hardly any of
the posts. I shut it down when the b2/cafelog<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> developers
announced they were shifting focus to some new project they called
“WordPress”.</li>
<li>closew.org – discussion of community and cooperative living, back
when I still thought consensus was the greatest political tool since
pork on sliced bread. Now I favor benevolent dictators<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> (so long
as he is me) and anarchy,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> especially anarcho-primitivism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li>woundedpig.com – an attempt to satirize scary conservatives. Took me
forever to write each post. Turns out I’m not Jon Stewart.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Look. And feel.</h2>
<p>What can I add beyond what I’ve said <a href="http://version2beta.com/about/" title="about version2beta's blog">on the about page</a>? As of this
writing, the blog has an extremely basic theme. One could call it naked,
except that would suggest you could see what lies underneath. Let’s say
it’s unadorned. I’m using the Roots theme<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> for these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 Boilerplate (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a>) makes
rock-solid HTML5 sites</li>
<li>960.gs (<a href="http://960.gs/">http://960.gs/</a>) makes 960px grid-based design easy</li>
<li>Cleaner URLs with a custom .htaccess</li>
<li>jQuery <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/" title="Malsup's jQuery Cycle. Vrooom.">Cycle</a> and <a href="http://fancybox.net/" title="Fancybox makes content pop.">FancyBox</a> – my two favorite jQuery plugins</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Roots is just a starter theme. Ideally the developer will
still style it, you know, choose those cleaner and more trustworthy
fonts, maybe add a logo, etc.? Take a look at this page. If you’re
seeing what I’m seeing (quite possibly not, since I’m at a different
point in the space-time continuum than you are), then the developer
(a/k/a me, version2beta, rob) has not gotten around to it.</p>
<p><strong>Updated 8/22/11:</strong> I've moved the blog onto my version2beta.com domain and now I'm using Hyde<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> to generate the site, so I'm not actually using Wordpress, Roots theme, or Apache, or even HTML5Boilerplate. Or FancyBox, jQuery Cycle, or jQuery <em>anything</em>. It's all rustic. I've gone native. (But I'll probably get around to making it look more designed eventually.)</p>
<p><strong>Updated 1/25/13:</strong> Changed it up again. I'll probably blog about the new platform. Basically it's a Flask<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> application with Frozen Flask<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> to save a static version, which is then uploaded to S3 and served via Route53.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Poke me.</h2>
<p>Look around at what I’ve written. Or maybe what I’m going to write, since so far all I’ve written is this and the about page. Or maybe, what I think I’m going to write. I’ll probably leave comments on, but really, don’t bother. If I’ve inspired a response from you (probably the type of response that deserves an apology), mention <a href="http://twitter.com/version2beta" title="Me, twitterfied">@version2beta</a> on Twitter and I’ll see it there. Or, if you can’t comment in less than 126 characters (my handle takes 14 characters with a space), blog about it and tweet that. I have my doubts about blogging (especially me blogging), but one thing it seems good for is inter-blogal discussions.</p>
