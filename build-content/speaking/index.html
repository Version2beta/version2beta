<h1>Upcoming presentations</h1>
<p>Right now, I have no scheduled presentations, and I've only submitted one presentation for consideration at a conference. Do you need a speaker? My most popular talks are <a href="/articles/navigating-the-bazaar" title="My Navigating the Bazaar presentation for That Conference">Navigating the Bazaar</a>, <a href="/articles/managing-risk-and-selling-value-wordcamp" title="Managing Risk and Selling Value, Wordcamp Milwaukee presentation">Managing Risk and Selling Value</a>, and <a href="/articles/dev-environments-with-vagrant-chef-and-git/" title="A transcript of my Dev Environments with Vagrant presentation">Dev Environments with Vagrant</a>.</p>
<h1>Presentations I've given</h1>
<p>I often have the opportunity to present at conferences, local tech meetups, and occasionally present for corporate training events. Here are some of the presentations I've given. Many of these presentations are available to schedule.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/session_870" title="Put People First: Navigating the bazaar of open source libraries">Navigating the bazaar of open source libraries</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thatconference.com" title="Summer camp for geeks">That Conference</a>, August 12 - 14, 2013 at Kalahari Resort, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing a software library — a module for a content management system, a gem for Ruby, a Python or Node.js package — is a daunting and sometimes improbable task. The community is prolific and choices are bewildering. Choosing well requires not only a technical analysis of features and code, but every bit as much an understanding of dynamic social relationships at work in the community. &quot;Put people first&quot; explores not only how to navigate this bazaar of coders and code, but also how to engage the authors, contribute in kind, and ultimately become part of the community.</p>

<h2><a href="http://2013.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/session/managing-risk-and-selling-value-wcbizdev/" title="My talk on pricing projects based on complexity, risk, and value.">Managing Risk and Selling Value</a></h2>
<p><em>Presented at <a href="http://2013.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/" title="Wordcamp Milwaukee">Wordcamp Milwaukee</a>, June 7 - 9, 2013 at Bucketworks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're a skilled practitioner of web crafts. You can make WordPress sing. You can get Google agog. You can send customers clicking to conversions. But do you know how much to charge? This presentation explores how the three prime factors for pricing your work — complexity, risk, and value — interact with each other. W'll also learn a C-R-V formula that helps you select the right jobs and makes each one lucrative for both you and your client.</p>

<h2>Civic hacking with IPython and Pandas</h2>
<p><em>Presented at a joint meetup between the <a href="http://milwaukeedata.org/" title="Web site for the Milwaukee Data Initiative">Milwaukee Data Initiative</a> (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/MKEData/" title="Meetup page for the Milwaukee Data Initiative">meetup</a>) and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Milwaukee-Tech-Engine/" title="Milwaukee Tech Engine focuses on engineering, even outside of web development">Milwaukee Tech Engine</a>, June 6, 2013, at Bucketworks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some programs are never meant to be written. Often we just have a bunch of data that we need to crunch or parse or munge or just understand better. Python, and the iPython Notebook give us some excellent tools for exploring a problem domain from the inside out, using a powerful scripting language that's still considered 'the easiest programming language to learn'. In this presentation, we'll work hands-on with iPython and the Pandas data analysis library to explore some 'big data' and see what kind of answers we can tease out of it.</p>

<p>A presentation on the MODX content management framework during a CMS megapanel discussion and presentation.</p>
<p>I created a Prezi for this presentation. <a href="http://prezi.com/xemmat6oavos/modx-can-beat-up-your-content-management-system/?kw=view-xemmat6oavos&amp;rc=ref-136841">You can view it at prezi.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Dev environments with Vagrant</h2>
<p><em>Presented at Fox Cities PHP<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> on May 8, 2013.</em></p>
<p><em>Presented at MKEPUG<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> on February 12, 2013.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtual development environments keep your workspace clean and predictable in dev and production, and creating a virtual development machine with Vagrant is quick and easy once you have all the pieces in place. Rob Martin (@version2beta) is going to put all the pieces together and hand them to you, and then show you how you can use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[A transcript of my presentation][vagranttrascript] is posted in my blog, if you want to see what I had to say. My <a href="/static/examples/vagrant-chef-git.html" title="Slidedeck for my Dev Environments with Vagrant presentation">slides are also available</a>.</p>
<h2>The Tyranny of the Database (lightning talk)</h2>
<p><em>Presented at RubyMKE<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>, April 16, 2013</em></p>
<p>This short talk explores the weaknesses of traditional databases and how we use them, and argues for using services for more decoupling of the data layer from the application layer. This is part one of a larger presentation I'm preparing on the Arbitrary framework.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/tyranny-of-the-database/">A transcript of my presentation</a> is posted in my blog, and <a href="/static/examples/tyranny-of-the-database.html">my slides are also available online</a>.</p>
<h2>How much should you charge? Managing risk and selling value.</h2>
<p><em>Presented at Web414<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1]</a></sup> on February 21, 2013.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're a skilled practitioner of web crafts. You can refactor a repulsive code repository. You can get Google agog. You can send customers clicking to conversions. But you don't know how much to charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>@version2beta's presentation explores how the three prime factors for pricing your work - complexity, risk, and value - interact with each other and help make the right jobs lucrative for you and your client.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This presentation is intended for freelance web craftspeople, bespoke design agencies, and boutique development firms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/articles/managing-risk-and-selling-value/">A transcript of my presentation</a> is posted in my blog. <a href="/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value.html">My slides</a> are also online. I made a <a href="/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value/crv-calculator.html">tool for calculating CRV Factors</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/dustyf">@dustyf</a> created a video of this presentation. The presentation starts at 17:30 and goes about 55 minutes. I think a few of the questions and answers were included, but not all - we continued informal discussion for more than an hour after the presentation. And if you enjoy the kind of humor that involves seeing people suffer, my computer locks up and I have to borrow another machine, and it's kind of funny in that sad way.</p>
<h2>Idiomatic Node.js patterns</h2>
<p><em>Presented at Bar Camp Milwaukee 7,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> October 2012</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever have a conversation with someone who speaks your language with a heavy accent? It helps to recognize the common patterns. Learning Node.js is much the same; sure it's javascript, but sometimes it is rather hard to follow. In this session we will review the three most essential patterns in Node.js: modules, callbacks, and streams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much to my surprise, a participant at this presentation <a href="http://archive.org/details/IdiomaticNode.jsPatterns">recorded audio and uploaded it to archive.org</a>. Also, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1VZu71L6nI5cZ2ZgvV1iNz8orOKTeTllOBgZp2AQwc/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p">I made my presentation slides public</a> on Google Drive.</p>
<h2>Get out of the Generic Aisle</h2>
<p><em>Presented at Web414, June 14, 2012</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arlen Walker (@arlen) and Rob Martin (@version2beta) will present Backbone.js as a tool to take your typical canned widget functionality a step further, and set your work apart from the masses. Backbone.js is a client-side JavaScript framework, but who really cares about that? What's important is what you can do with it. Arlen and Rob will live code (ooh, scary!) a Twitter widget demonstrating backbone's ability to easily acquire, process and present arbitrary data from diverse sources. <strong>Speakers:</strong> Rob and Arlen worked on their first project together over two decades ago - they just didn't know it at the time. It was the 1992 Solar and Electric Vehicle Association race. Arlen was on the battery team, and Rob was on the embedded controls team, and the car won first place. Today, Arlen programs under his own flag, Paladin Web Services, and Rob is top devops person at Top Floor Technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arlen and I prepared our slides using Showoff, a Ruby framework on Sinatra for presentations. They're online at <a href="https://github.com/Version2beta/backboneslides">https://github.com/Version2beta/backboneslides</a>. Rather than live code, we created a git repository with tags for twelve steps in the presentation. That's at <a href="https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget-presentation">https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget-presentation</a>. During our demonstration we produced a backbone-based twitter widget, which is at <a href="https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget">https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget</a>.</p>
<h2>5 Cool Things About PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>An overview of new features in PostgreSQL version 9.</p>
<p>I created a Prezi for this presentation, and <a href="http://prezi.com/bggemp3ca7em/5-cool-things-about-postgresql/?kw=view-bggemp3ca7em&amp;rc=ref-136841">you can view it online</a>.</p>
