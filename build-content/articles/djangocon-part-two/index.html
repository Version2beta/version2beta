<p>Oh my, I'm not good at this. There are people around live-blogging (and live-noting) the conference, and I'm scraping the sleepiness off my face enough to see the screen, only to realize I don't actually remember yesterday very well. I may be exagerating a little, but I did not take adequate notes (sorry, PyDanny - I heard you on this, really I did.)</p>
<h2>DjangoCon agenda</h2>
<p>Here's the recap of my first day:</p>
<h3>David Eaves' keynote on the science of community</h3>
<p>David Eaves is awesome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> He doesn't know much about the Django community, but he clearly knows about communities, including open source communities. Mostly he talked about two topics: using metrics to track and plan within a community, and using negotiation theory to include more people more effectively. Here was an important, but only peripheral, take-away: the involvement of women in an open source project is a key indicator of the health of the project.</p>
<h3>From designer to Django'er in six weeks</h3>
<p>I understand that Alex was ill in the morning, so his slot went to Adam Nelson for 'Testing with Lettuce and Splinter'. I arrived about four minutes in, and left about eight minutes in. I'm sure it was a valuable talk. I've even heard that from someone who stayed. I missed the discussion on BDD (behavior driven development), and given that my testing experience is in many ways nascent, I decided that learning alternatives was further out than I was ready for.</p>
<p>What I did instead was listen to Tracy Osborn's<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> fascinating 'From Designer to Django'er in Six Weeks: A Story from Solo Founder'.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> Anecdotes of learning not just Django, but of becoming an entrepreneur with Django.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alex did present in the afternoon, opposite Frank Wiles' PostgreSQL Performance talk, so I did not see him then either.</p>

<h3>Confessions of Joe Developer</h3>
<p>Danny claims to be lazy and stupid, which is not only a solid rhetorical tool but also a good starting point for learning complex systems. I half expected to hear a reference to Larry Walls' three virtues of a good programmer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> (In fact, it would have fit right in, except for the language mismatch.)</p>
<p>A good portion of his presentation described various methods for saving time, not relying on memorization, and the merits of doing things &quot;the dumb way&quot;. His example contrasts urllib2 with the requests library<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also terrifically important, Danny talked about diversity at the conference - PyLadies,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> women in tech, our wives and daughters, the role of men in creating open and diverse environments. I like the thought, and believe Danny's sincere desire to make it all better. At the same time, as men we risk being the patron by being involved at all. There's much more to be said here, but I'm reluctant to say it for fear my position stands counter to the enlightened attitudes around DjangoCon. It does not. I salute the efforts to include women, to build an inclusive environment and to identify narratives and behaviors that interfere. I think I'll stick with helping my daughter with her AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics homework. If she even needs help.</p>

<h3>The story and tech of Read the Docs</h3>
<p>I like devops.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> I'm fascinated by it. Eric Holscher's discussion on Read the Doc kept my attention as much as anything for how they solved the devops questions - clearly, that is the essence of Eric's work, right?</p>
<h3>Testing - The developer strikes back</h3>
<p>This was the densest presentation I've seen at Djangon yet. Sandy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> laid it down at 10 MBPS, I swear. I knew little about &quot;real&quot; testing practices before I went in, and now I have enough familiarity with the universe of options, I'm highly likely to recognize them when I finally sit down and learn them right.</p>

<h3>Secrets of PostgreSQL performance</h3>
<p>I've known of Frank Wiles and Revolution Systems<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> for about as long as I've used PostgreSQL, so much of what he offered wasn't brand new to me. But some of it was new - tablespaces, for instance.</p>
