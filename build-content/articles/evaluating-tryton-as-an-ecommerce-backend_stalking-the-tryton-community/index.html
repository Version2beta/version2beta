This part discusses some of my experiences with members of the Tryton community.</p>
<p>The whole series, at least as planned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/articles/evaluating-tryton-as-an-ecommerce-backend_about-tryton" title="Tryton as an e-commerce back-end: About Tryton">Part 1: About Tryton</a></li>
<li>Part 2: Stalking the Tryton community</li>
<li><a href="/articles/evaluating-tryton-as-an-ecommerce-backend_web-framework" title="Tryton as an e-commerce back-end: Tryton needs a web framework.">Part 3: The crux of the matter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Tryton community</h2>
<p>My first experience with Tryton was two years ago, when we were
evaluating open source ERP packages for a business systems
integration project. I came, I saw, and I moved on to OpenERP,
which offered more features and centralized commercial support. Now
that we have considerably more experience with OpenERP, I’ve come
back for a closer look at Tryton.</p>
<p>I started with the community, and I suspect that is a very valid
approach. I’m looking for a long term relationship. I wanted to
meet the family. So naturally I hid behind some bushes and watched
them for a month or so. Some of the things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don’t bicker very much. Like, hardly at all. Most of the
communication I’ve seen is in non-native English, and they speak
carefully so as not to be misunderstood.</li>
<li>Mostly they are proactive, identifying potential problems and
solutions before people become invested in various outcomes.</li>
<li>They air their laundry (bugs, issues, etc) as well as most open
source projects. It seems they don’t have as much laundry to air,
though.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tryton family has some key members. I’ve identified some of
them from looking at the services page on the website<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, some
from the Google groups for Tryton<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> and Tryton-dev<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, and some
on IRC<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. Many of these people I also recognized from the OpenERP
community, as there’s considerable overlap. I’m reluctant to point
names and name fingers (with a nod to Jack Sparrow<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>) as I’m far
too likely to miss someone’s most excellent contribution, and that
would be an unfortunate oversight.  <strong>Kudos and gratitude to everyone who has worked on Tryton.</strong> Despite my reluctance, I still want to point out a few people.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a reason why the Tryton.org website<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> looks so
much like <strong>B2CK Software Development’s website<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></strong>. I’ve read
hundreds of emails on the mailing lists from Cédric Krier, Nicolas
Évrard, and others in this company. Clearly these are key people in
Tryton development and I cannot say enough nice things. Cédric is a
programming god: targeted, responsive, attentive, and sharp. I
greatly enjoyed the night Udo Spallek recommended two accessibility
improvements to the Tryton GUI and Cédric replied 52 minutes later
with the one word “Done”.</p>
<p>I already had a healthy respect (perhaps even a geek-crush) on
<strong>Sharoon Thomas</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>, CEO of <strong>Openlabs in the UK and India</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>.
Sharoon and Openlabs have written about
using Tryton as a Python module in Django<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup>,
integrated UPS international shipping with OpenERP<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>, and built
Callisto e-commerce for OpenERP<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> as well as
Nereid for Tryton<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>. Sharoon has clearly already considered the
question of Tryton and e-commerce, as indicated in
his email list discussion on building a Magento Connector for Tryton<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>. (My favorite part: “An integration with
Magento does not add 'The best e-commerce possibility for Tryton'
but does make 'A great ERP backend for Magento'.&quot;)</p>
<p>Again I want to add, there are others. I can just barely read
French, German, and Spanish, and do not know the developers who
spend most of their time in these channels. Even among the
participants in the English language forums, I’m not representing
everyone here, but I do wish to include them in my appreciation.</p>
