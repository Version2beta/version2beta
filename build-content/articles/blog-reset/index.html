I was frankly embarrased to tweet links to it - often it wouldn't come up at all. Now that's all changed. Now my blog is on Django. (But only kinda.)</p>
<p>A month ago I heard from a potential customer in Chicago who needs to move a site from Wordpress to Django.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> They'd heard about me in particular from a colleague, and wanted to know if I could help.</p>
<p>Of course I could! I've been learning Django for months. I even have the Django book.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> I've even <em>read</em> the Django book. Parts of it, anyway. And I do have tickets for DjangoCon<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> in Portland next month.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the colleague might have oversold me. It wasn't complete radio silence when I said I didn't have any production Django sites she could look at, but it was close.</p>
<p>&quot;But I was thinking of moving my blog onto Django. I could probably have that done over the weekend.&quot; I could hear her slight sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I didn't move my blog onto Django that weekend. What I did with my weekend was build out two sets of high-availability server pairs and write up a how-to on the same.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> Then, at 5:30pm on the night before my 6:15am train to Chicago to meet with this customer, I sat down to figure out how I could get my blog onto Django, quickly.</p>
<p>I was already somewhat familiar with Hyde<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. It's a static site generator written in Python, inspired by a remarkably similar Jekyll<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> written in Ruby. Conveniently, Hyde is also based on Django, using both the settings.py file and Django templates, so I'd be able to use some of what I already knew to show off what I might be able to do for a customer using Django. Because that's what every customer needs, right? A small, unobtrusive, under-designed blog-like website that uses Django templates?</p>
<p>My whole blog did not get moved that evening, but I did post the high-availability write-up in a blog section of a website I called &quot;proof of concept&quot;. That was convenient, since the new site is hosted on one of the server pairs I'd just built, and the write-up was a key take-away for my presentation at Web414<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> the next night on cloud hosting.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks passed before I got back to the project, but I did finally move my blog. I also improved the design some, though of course it's still small, unobtrusive, under-designed, and blog-like. I did away with almost all of my inline links in blog posts, opting for footnotes instead. Not only does this make the reading easier (and less spammy-looking), it gives me more room to be snarky<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> out-of-band. (There are many fine examples of footnoting bloggers, but as usual Barbara<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> has the most influence on me.) I'd also been wanting to use Disqus for comments, and figured it'd be best to do that while I only have 8 comments to figure out what to do with. (Note: if you are one of the people who'd commented on my old blog, please accept my apology as I decide how, when, and if to move them.)</p>
<p>I haven't heard back from the Chicago customer yet, which is probably okay because they wanted freelance, and I would want to run it through QMUXS.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> But in spite of the dubious benefit of the sales call, I worked through the new high-availability challenges, built up the new servers, got to work with Django more, and built a new fast fast fast website for version2beta.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
