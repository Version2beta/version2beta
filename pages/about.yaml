## About version2beta ##

When I first started this blog, my primary job was Chief Superhero at Quintessential Mischief LLC[^qmllc], making systems be more systemic. The rest of the time I did all sorts of fun things, like bother famous developers in other countries with odd ideas about how their applications could be more paranoidly secure. Sometimes I work nights as Version2beta LLC, building firewalls, servers or workstations, or maybe writing an odd bit of code, or working the obscurity out of uncommon problems.

And then, once every blue moon, I wrote something for my blog. That would be this site.

Life changed. Our biggest customer (too big, really) took a crap on us, cancelling and not paying on tens of thousands of dollars of contracts and invoices. They had reasons - the project had been based on OpenERP for instance -- but we were their partner, not their outhouse.

So I took a job. It's a good one, working with some really good people, at Top Floor Technologies in New Berlin, Wisconsin.[^topfloor] Check out my [hire me][] page for more details. I'm also working with Quintessential Mischief one or two nights a week (my wife still owns and operates it, it's just smaller now), and I still do a very small amount of freelance work as Version2beta.

And I still write this blog.

From our clients I've learned how valuable a blog can be, provided *someone wants to be a writer*. That's not me. I am neither a writer nor a blogger, and as such have limited expectations from this blog:

-   A collection of notes about my work. I work with:
    -   Networks (often with OpenBSD[^OpenBSD] and pfSense[^pfSense] in major roles)
    -   Real and virtual servers (both Linode[^Linode] and AWS[^AWS])
    -   Linux (usually Ubuntu[^Ubuntu] and Debian[^Debian])
    -   Databases (usually MySQL[^MySQL] and PostgreSQL[^Postgres] but I'm fascinated by various post-SQL and no-SQL choices).
    -   Programming. I primarily program in languages prefixed by the letter "P": Python, PHP, and Perl, but I sometimes delve deep for my long-lost experiences with C/C++, Forth, .NET, and a dozen other languages.
    -   Platforms. I'm spending most of my time in two platforms: MODX[^MODX] and Tryton[^Tryton], though I strongly suspect I'll be adding Django[^Django] and Flask[^Flask] to that short list soon. *News flash!* In my new position, I am also using Drupal[^drupal]. I wouldn't have expected that, but I'm actually kinda glad it happened.

-   A repository of code and snippets, often just so I can find them later.
-   A place to respond to other peoples' blogs, because blogging is the newleave a comme. (Actually, I think blogging is dead. Or almost. Maybe I'll blog about that.)
-   I *might possibly* blog nonsense every now and then. You know, only if I'm feeling extremely moved by a subject. You can safely ignore those posts.

Hopefully I've set realistic expectations for the reader. Hopefully I will be able to exceed those expectations every now and then.

__Update 5/9/2011:__ See my [Instantiate Blog][] post for more of the whys and wherefores.

[^qmllc]: [Quintessential Mischief LLC makes systems, especially ERP and e-commerce systems][qm], and we like to customize where appropriate. My real title is Application Architect, but I'm thinking about getting it changed to more accurately reflect what I do.
[qm]: http://www.qmuxs.com "Quintessential Mischief LLC"
  [^topfloor]: [Top Floor Technologies][topfloor] focuses on B2B internet strategy, and they have the right people working at doing it very well. We are on the way up.
  [topfloor]: http://www.topfloortech.com/ "B2B marketing, SEO and SEM, analytics. And a damn fine web infrastructure manager too."
  [hire me]: /hire "Want to hire me?"
  [^OpenBSD]: [OpenBSD is secure][OpenBSD], and secure is good.
  [OpenBSD]: http://www.openbsd.org "OpenBSD: free, functional, and secure."
  [^pfSense]: [pfSense][] puts OpenBSD's packet filter on a FreeBSD prepackaged system with a front-end management system. Mostly good, and the upgrade to 2.0rc3 was flawless, but I still don't understand why it runs on FreeBSD instead of OpenBSD.
  [pfSense]: http://www.pfsense.org "pfSense project home."
  [^Linode]: Check out [Linode][]. I really like my virtual private servers there.
  [Linode]: http://www.linode.com "Linode stands for Linux Node."
  [^AWS]: I use a number of [Amazon web services][aws]: EC2, S3, CloudFront, etc..
  [aws]: http://aws.amazon.com "From here you can get to all of Amazon's web services."
  [^Ubuntu]: I can install [Ubuntu][] machines all day long. Sometimes, I do install Ubuntu machines all day long.
  [Ubuntu]: http://www.ubuntu.com "Fast, easy, free Linux, with slick packaging."
  [^Debian]: So many of my Linux heroes have worked on the [Debian][] project.
  [Debian]: http://www.debian.org "I like that Debian makes clear it is a Gnu/Linux operating system."
  [^MySQL]: Like many developers I have mixed feelings about [Oracle/MySQL][MySQL].
  [MySQL]: http://www.mysql.com "Oracle has been a bit evil over the last few years, maybe longer."
  [^Postgres]: I was slow to realize how powerful and fast [PostgreSQL][] actually is.
  [PostgreSQL]: http://www.postgresql.org "PostgreSQL is also a fine example of the community open source business model."
  [^MODX]: I used to describe [MODX][] as the best content management system/framework, but I become less comfortable with it as they move toward their commercial open-source business model. I don't begrudge them a profit, of course.
  [MODX]: http://modx.com "MODX content management framework"
  [^Tryton]: [Tryton Enterprise Resource Planning platform][Tryton]. I'm doing a lot of my development in Tryton now, which of course moves us beyond the web and into the warehouse and factory.
  [Tryton]: http://tryton.org "There are some excellent programmers working on this project."
  [^Django]: [Django][] is a legendary Python-based content management framework, created by a major newspaper publisher and used in pretty serious websites all over.
  [Django]: http://www.djangoproject.com "I think I may become a Djangonaut."
  [^Flask]: [Flask][] is a Python microframework, kinda like a smaller version of Django without the ORM and a few other things.
  [Flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask is a Pocoo project, like Pygments and Werkzeug. These people are good."
  [^drupal]: Drupal is a content management platform with a vibrant community and tons of features. Tons of features, probably even a kitchen sink. I've described it as the RV of the CMS/AF world.
  [drupal]: http://drupal.org/ "Drupal software and community."
