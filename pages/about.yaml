Hi, I'm Rob. Or you can call me version2beta if you like.

## About version2beta ##

I'm a geek and a rad dad dude[^rdd] who likes to be outside, listen to music, camp, and hike &mdash; sometimes all at the same time. My work in tech not only keeps me happy and off the streets, it also pays for the beer and the kids.

I write (mostly here), speak on tech topics[^speaking], and do devops[^devops] and coding.

For a while, my primary job was Chief Superhero at Quintessential Mischief LLC[^qmllc]. Now I work for Tartan Solutions, Inc.[^tartan]

  [^rdd]: Really. Rad Dad Dude. When I remarried we asked the kids to come up with new names for us, so as to avoid confusion with their parents in other homes. They chose **Rad Dad Dude** (RDD for short) for me.
  [^speaking]: Often when I need to learn something new, I sign up to give a presentation on the topic at a local tech meetup. Amazing what a deadline and an audience of 25 or 50 people can do for your motivation. I have a page [listing some presentations][speaking] I have given or can give for a technical audience.
  [speaking]: /speaking "Some presentations I give"
  [^devops]: [Devops][devops] is where software development, quality assurance, and operations all come together. When they get there, they hang out and drink beers together, talk a lot, and figure out some of the coolest tech anywhere. Oh, and all devops engineers are superheroes.
  [devops]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps "A software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration."
  [^qmllc]: [Quintessential Mischief LLC makes websites more strategic and usable.][qm]
