# Pair program with me

It's seems that Avdi Grimm[^avdi] started this cool thing called \#pairwithme[^pairwithme]. Use the hash tag on Twitter as a welcome mat for pair programming.

My mat is out. [Email me](mailto:rob@version2beta.com) or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/version2beta) and let's get started.

Thank you for the encouragement, Avdi!

## Pair-and-tell

2013-04-10 Remote paired with [@StephenBallNC](https://twitter.com/StephenBallNC) over our lunch hours. Worked on a Words With Friends cheater script and explored Ruby's Array intersection abilities.

_Venue: Google Hangout, my EC2 t1.micro instance, Ubuntu, tmux, vim, chruby, Ruby 2.0.0, rspec._
