# Presentations I've given

I often have the opportunity to present at local tech meetups, and occasionally present for corporate training events. Here are some of the presentations I've given. Many of these presentations are available to schedule.

## How much should you charge? Managing risk and selling value.

*Presenting at Web414[^web414] on February 21, 2013.*

> You're a skilled practitioner of web crafts. You can refactor a repulsive code repository. You can get Google agog. You can send customers clicking to conversions. But you don't know how much to charge.

> @version2beta's presentation explores how the three prime factors for pricing your work - complexity, risk, and value - interact with each other and help make the right jobs lucrative for you and your client.

> This presentation is intended for freelance web craftspeople, bespoke design agencies, and boutique development firms.

[A transcript of my presentation](/articles/managing-risk-and-selling-value/) is posted in my blog. [My slides](/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value.html) are also online. I made a [tool for calculating CRV Factors](/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value/crv-calculator.html).

## Smooth moves with Vagrant, Chef-solo, and git

*Presented at MKEPUG[^mkepug] on February 12, 2013.*

> Virtual development environments keep your workspace clean and predictable in dev and production, and creating a virtual development machine with Vagrant is quick and easy once you have all the pieces in place. Rob Martin (@version2beta) is going to put all the pieces together and hand them to you, and then show you how you can use them.

[A transcript of my presentation](/articles/dev-environments-with-vagrant-chef-and-git/) is posted in my blog, if you want to see what I had to say. My [slides are also available](/static/examples/vagrant-chef-git.html).

## Idiomatic Node.js patterns

*Presented at Bar Camp Milwaukee 7,[^bcmke] October 2012*

> Ever have a conversation with someone who speaks your language with a heavy accent? It helps to recognize the common patterns. Learning Node.js is much the same; sure it's javascript, but sometimes it is rather hard to follow. In this session we will review the three most essential patterns in Node.js: modules, callbacks, and streams.

Much to my surprise, a participant at this presentation [recorded audio and uploaded it to archive.org](http://archive.org/details/IdiomaticNode.jsPatterns). Also, [I made my presentation slides public](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1VZu71L6nI5cZ2ZgvV1iNz8orOKTeTllOBgZp2AQwc/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p) on Google Drive.
