# Presentations I'd like to give

## Put people first: Navigating the bazaar of open source libraries

[I've proposed this talk](http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/1059) for Open Source Bridge 2013, June 18 - 21, in Portland, Oregon:[^osbridge]

> Choosing a software library &mdash; a module for a content management system, a gem for Ruby, a Python or Node.js package &mdash; is a daunting and sometimes improbable task. The community is prolific and choices are bewildering. Choosing well requires not only a technical analysis of features and code, but every bit as much an understanding of dynamic social relationships at work in the community. "Put people first" explores not only how to navigate this bazaar of coders and code, but also how to engage the authors, contribute in kind, and ultimately become part of the community.

## The Tyranny of the Database

I'm preparing this presentation first as a lightning talk for PyCon 2013, March 15 - 17, in Santa Clara, California. The topic will quickly draw attention to the problems with using a database, especially a single database, as our canonical representation of state or reality. From there I'll question the value of ORMs, and the common practice of imposing schema on data.

# Presentations I've given

I often have the opportunity to present at local tech meetups, and occasionally present for corporate training events. Here are some of the presentations I've given. Many of these presentations are available to schedule.

## How much should you charge? Managing risk and selling value.

*Presented at Web414[^web414] on February 21, 2013.*

> You're a skilled practitioner of web crafts. You can refactor a repulsive code repository. You can get Google agog. You can send customers clicking to conversions. But you don't know how much to charge.

> @version2beta's presentation explores how the three prime factors for pricing your work - complexity, risk, and value - interact with each other and help make the right jobs lucrative for you and your client.

> This presentation is intended for freelance web craftspeople, bespoke design agencies, and boutique development firms.

[A transcript of my presentation](/articles/managing-risk-and-selling-value/) is posted in my blog. [My slides](/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value.html) are also online. I made a [tool for calculating CRV Factors](/static/examples/managing-risk-and-selling-value/crv-calculator.html).

Also, [@dustyf](https://twitter.com/dustyf) created a video of this presentation. The presentation starts at 17:30 and goes about 55 minutes. I think a few of the questions and answers were included, but not all - we continued informal discussion for more than an hour after the presentation. And if you enjoy the kind of humor that involves seeing people suffer, my computer locks up and I have to borrow another machine, and it's kind of funny in that sad way.

## Smooth moves with Vagrant, Chef-solo, and git

*Presented at MKEPUG[^mkepug] on February 12, 2013.*

> Virtual development environments keep your workspace clean and predictable in dev and production, and creating a virtual development machine with Vagrant is quick and easy once you have all the pieces in place. Rob Martin (@version2beta) is going to put all the pieces together and hand them to you, and then show you how you can use them.

[A transcript of my presentation](/articles/dev-environments-with-vagrant-chef-and-git/) is posted in my blog, if you want to see what I had to say. My [slides are also available](/static/examples/vagrant-chef-git.html).

## Idiomatic Node.js patterns

*Presented at Bar Camp Milwaukee 7,[^bcmke] October 2012*

> Ever have a conversation with someone who speaks your language with a heavy accent? It helps to recognize the common patterns. Learning Node.js is much the same; sure it's javascript, but sometimes it is rather hard to follow. In this session we will review the three most essential patterns in Node.js: modules, callbacks, and streams.

Much to my surprise, a participant at this presentation [recorded audio and uploaded it to archive.org](http://archive.org/details/IdiomaticNode.jsPatterns). Also, [I made my presentation slides public](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1VZu71L6nI5cZ2ZgvV1iNz8orOKTeTllOBgZp2AQwc/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p) on Google Drive.

## Get out of the Generic Aisle

*Presented at Web414, June 14, 2012*

> Arlen Walker (@arlen) and Rob Martin (@version2beta) will present Backbone.js as a tool to take your typical canned widget functionality a step further, and set your work apart from the masses. Backbone.js is a client-side JavaScript framework, but who really cares about that? What's important is what you can do with it. Arlen and Rob will live code (ooh, scary!) a Twitter widget demonstrating backbone's ability to easily acquire, process and present arbitrary data from diverse sources. **Speakers:** Rob and Arlen worked on their first project together over two decades ago - they just didn't know it at the time. It was the 1992 Solar and Electric Vehicle Association race. Arlen was on the battery team, and Rob was on the embedded controls team, and the car won first place. Today, Arlen programs under his own flag, Paladin Web Services, and Rob is top devops person at Top Floor Technologies.

Arlen and I prepared our slides using Showoff, a Ruby framework on Sinatra for presentations. They're online at [https://github.com/Version2beta/backboneslides](https://github.com/Version2beta/backboneslides). Rather than live code, we created a git repository with tags for twelve steps in the presentation. That's at [https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget-presentation](https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget-presentation). During our demonstration we produced a backbone-based twitter widget, which is at [https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget](https://github.com/Version2beta/backbone-twidget).

## MODX can beat up your Content Management System

*Presented at the Milwaukee Web Design Meetup,[^mwdm] December 2011*

A presentation on the MODX content management framework during a CMS megapanel discussion and presentation.

I created a Prezi for this presentation. [You can view it at prezi.com](http://prezi.com/xemmat6oavos/modx-can-beat-up-your-content-management-system/?kw=view-xemmat6oavos&rc=ref-136841).

## 5 Cool Things About PostgreSQL

*Presented at Bar Camp Milwaukee 6,[^bcmke] October 2011*

An overview of new features in PostgreSQL version 9.

I created a Prezi for this presentation, and [you can view it online](http://prezi.com/bggemp3ca7em/5-cool-things-about-postgresql/?kw=view-bggemp3ca7em&rc=ref-136841).

## @version2beta's Prezi Prezi

At DjangoCon 2011 I presented a lightning talk showing off Prezi. It's online at [blip.tv](http://blip.tv/djangocon/lightning-talks-wed-am-5576513) and [PyVideo.org](http://pyvideo.org/video/74/djangocon-2011--lightning-talks---wednesday-morni). My talk is last, starting at 16:20. [My Prezi is also available online](http://prezi.com/ntrlqxhxpzbv/a-prezi-on-prezi-for-djangocon/?kw=view-ntrlqxhxpzbv&rc=ref-136841).
