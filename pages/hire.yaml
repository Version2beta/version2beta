# Current status: not in the market

My current position is **software and systems engineer** with [Tartan Solutions, Inc.][tartan] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I do devops and when I'm lucky, some coding on their PlaidCloud platform.

I also support projects and services at [Quintessential Mischief LLC][qmllc], my wife's company. Talk to her about web strategy, search optimization, usability, accessability, and social media. I highly recommend her on objective (as well as subjective) terms. **She fights for the user**.

I am occasionally available for consultating and small coding or systems administration projects. [My résumé is available online][resume] and you can [email me](mailto:rob@version2beta.com).
