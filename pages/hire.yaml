My current position is **Web Infrastructure Manager** at [Top Floor Technologies][topfloor] in New Berlin, Wisconsin. I am managing website hosting and contract systems administration, back-end programming, and application development. Top Floor focuses on B2B websites (with some B2C), SEO and SEM contracts, and electronic marketing. [Contact me there][tfemail] for more information. I don't do sales, project management, or customer service (yes, I like this job!) but I do support nearly a dozen talented people who provide those customer-centric services, and I would be thrilled to introduce you to them.

I also support projects and services at [Quintessential Mischief LLC][qmllc], my wife's company. Talk to her about web strategy, search optimization, usability, accessability, and social media. I highly recommend her on objective (as well as subjective) terms. **She fights for the user**.

Under *extremely rare* circumstances, I may be available for consultation about your project. [My résumé is available online][resume] and you can [email me](mailto:rob@version2beta.com).
