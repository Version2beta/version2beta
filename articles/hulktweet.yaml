longtitle: A Tweet about The Hulk in a post about not posting my tweets.

  I explain how I won't post my tweets to my blog, and then I post one.

# An exception

I won't make a habit of archiving my twitter stream here. Most of what I've said on Twitter is best ignored by the present, let alone posterity.

When my ego is stroked just right by my own cleverness, a tweet may land here.

> Last night I dreamt Bruce Banner hadn't aged but Hulk had. Young Bruce becomes tottering gray-green Hulk. I dreamt I was old Hulk.[^hulktweet]

So yeah, that's how my morning is going.
